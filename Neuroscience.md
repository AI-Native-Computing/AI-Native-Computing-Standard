## Abstract

This paper introduces a structural theory of cognition in which memory, identity, and reasoning emerge from a dynamically growing decision tree. We demonstrate that memory alone is insufficient for recall or identity formation. Instead, **structure — specifically, the existence of entrenched routing paths across experience — defines the boundary between unconscious storage and usable cognition**. This insight provides a unified explanation for childhood amnesia, the developmental timeline of the prefrontal cortex, and the transition from reactive to reflective cognition. The proposed model is biologically plausible, computationally verifiable, and aligned with principles of parsimony and evolutionary feasibility.

## 1. Introduction

Early cognitive development is often explained in terms of maturing brain regions or biochemical changes. Yet such models fail to explain why memories formed during infancy are not accessible later in life, despite evidence of early encoding. We propose a first-principles framework: **what matters is not when memories are encoded, but when they become routable**. This reframes development as a problem of data access — not storage.

## 2. The Core Hypothesis

> **Memory is not cognition. Memory + routing structure = cognition.**

Cognition emerges when stored experiences can be revisited via structured decision paths. These paths — a branching tree of conditionally reinforced evaluations — represent reflexes, habits, behaviors, and theories as **entrenchment phases** on a shared substrate.

### 2.1 Entrenchment Spectrum

| Phase      | Properties                                     | Plasticity | Retrieval |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|
| Reflex     | Fast, automatic, immutable                     | Very low   | Immediate |
| Habit      | Contextual, efficient, trainable               | Low        | Triggered |
| Behavior   | Deliberate, pattern-based                      | Medium     | Selective |
| Theory     | Abstract, symbolic, multi-contextual           | High       | Constructive |

This structure explains how memory transitions from unconscious imprinting to purposeful recollection.

## 3. Developmental Implications

### 3.1 Why We Don't Remember Being Infants

- Early memories are **encoded without structured retrieval paths**.
- Stored at **sensorimotor granularity**, lacking symbolic summaries.
- Tree branches for recall don't exist — memory is orphaned.
- Without structure, **emotion and memory lack re-entrance**.

### 3.2 The Birth of Self

The "self" arises when:

- **Experience becomes recursively accessible**.
- The cognitive tree forms **self-referential nodes**.
- Memories can reference *their own meaning*, not just their contents.

> **The self is not born — it’s compiled.**

## 4. Cognitive Tree as a Deterministic Architecture

The tree architecture enables:

- Stable behavior without stochastic modeling.
- Forward traversal for action.
- Backward traversal for reflection or revision.
- Selective memory indexing based on historical utility.

## 5. Evolutionary Feasibility

- **Darwin-Complete**: No stage requires non-beneficial intermediates.
- Reinforcement mechanisms can operate on failed or partial branches.
- Structure evolves from exposure + utility — not explicit instruction.

---

## 6. Academic and Practical Impact

- Resolves gaps in existing models of childhood amnesia and PFC development.
- Suggests new measures of cognitive maturity based on structural depth.
- Offers a formal scaffold for building interpretable AI systems.
- Enables low-cost agents to gain identity without pretrained models or datasets.
- Bridges neuroscience, AI, cybernetics, and philosophy under a single architecture.

## 7. Conclusion

Cognition, identity, and recall are emergent properties of a branching structure over time. Memory is necessary — but without decision-tree structure, it is inert. **Structure is access. Access is cognition. Cognition is self.** This model suggests new experiments in neuroscience, and offers a blueprint for the first truly understandable, evolvable artificial minds.
