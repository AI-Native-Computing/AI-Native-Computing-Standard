# AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS)

**AINCS** defines the foundational architecture, execution model, and system requirements for applications where AI is not an external service — but a persistent, embedded intelligence.

In the AINCS-compliant ecosystem, AI Agents connect to multiple applications simultaneously, observe in real time, act through the same channels as humans, and adapt continuously to evolving state without prior training. This shift — from stateless inference to stateful presence — unlocks more than just responsiveness. It gives rise to **true adaptability**, where agents evolve alongside the systems they inhabit.

Over time, these agents accumulate context, refine goals, and exhibit **emergent intelligence**.

## 📜 What is AINCS?
AINCS is an open, formalized standard that establishes AI as a persistent, first-class execution entity within software architectures. It defines:
- AI process continuity & persistent execution models
- Standardized AI system interaction protocols
- State management & memory persistence frameworks
- Governance models for AI interoperability
