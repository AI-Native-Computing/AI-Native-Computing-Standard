# AINCS License — Human Summary (v1.0)

**This is a summary. The full license is available at [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/AI-Native-Computing/AI-Native-Computing-Standard/blob/main/LICENSE.md) and governs all use.**

---

## 🚦 Quick Summary

AINCS is free to use — **unless**:

- Your organization earns **more than $10 million USD per year**, **or**
- You **sell or license** your AINCS-powered software or agents to an organization that does, **or**
- Your product, company, or AINCS technology is **acquired by another entity**.

These conditions trigger a **commercial license requirement** — not as a penalty, but as a fair contribution to support the ecosystem.

AINCS was built to **empower developers and protect the public good**, not to become a free engine for unchecked corporate consolidation.

If you’re unsure, just ask: **contactus@ainativecomputing.org**

## ✅ Free Use Includes:

- Independent developers
- Startups under $10M

## 🧭 Why This Exists

This protects the standard, keeps it free for builders, and ensures  
that **those profiting at scale** support its future.

> Small teams build.  
> Big companies pay their share.  
> Nobody gets owned.
