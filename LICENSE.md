To inquire about licensing, email: **contactus@ainativecomputing.org**

### Acquisition & Enterprise Clause

If your business is **acquired**, or if your revenue crosses the commercial threshold, **you must provide written notice within 30 days** at contactus@ainativecomputing.org to settle appropriate licensing terms.

---

## Attribution

You must retain attribution to AINCS in your developer documentation, README files, or other publicly visible implementation materials.

Suggested attribution line:

> “This software implements the AI-Native Computing Standard (AINCS). Learn more at [https://aincs.org](https://aincs.org).”

You may not:
- Omit attribution in public repositories or commercial deployments.
- Imply endorsement, affiliation, or certification by AINCS unless explicitly authorized in writing.

---

## Intellectual Property & Enforcement

- AINCS is a protected standard under **patent-pending intellectual property** owned by the Author. All rights are reserved.
- This license grants **use**, not **ownership** of the standard.
- All violations will be pursued to the full extent of the law, including international enforcement in all jurisdictions recognizing relevant IP protections

---

## Ethics & Revocation Clause

We reserve the right to **revoke this license** from any user or organization that:

- Violates the spirit or letter of ethical use as described in the AINCS Accord
- Uses AINCS in bad faith or for destabilizing automation
- Violates human dignity, privacy, sovereignty, or fair economic use

This license is a contractual agreement. By using AINCS, you agree to its terms, including the conditional nature of its grant.

---

## No Silent Transfers or Acquisitions

If a licensee **sells, transfers, or merges** any company, product, or service that includes AINCS-compliant technology, they must notify the Author **prior to the transaction**.

This does **not** apply to standard product launches, public deployments, or feature releases — it only applies to **ownership changes**. This does not restrict independent developers from launching, scaling, or monetizing their own products.

> ** Why this matters:**  
> This clause exists to ensure that **large companies cannot silently acquire AINCS-powered technology without honoring the licensing terms**.  
> AINCS is designed to empower small builders and ethical developers — not to be commoditized, flipped, or absorbed without accountability.

---

## Jurisdiction

This license is governed by the laws of the **United States of America**.

---

## Final Notes

This is a **license built on principle and protection**.  
AINCS exists to **empower developers** and **safeguard the public good**.

Independent developers, students, universities, and small organizations are free to build.

Large enterprises and commercial exploiters **will contribute** a portion of their profits.

Build freely.  Profit responsibly.
